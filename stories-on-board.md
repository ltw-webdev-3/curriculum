      ## Things to sketch

      - The HTML elements: `<div>`, `<img>`, `<h1>`…
      - Grid units, type sizes, modules, etc.
      - The CSS properties for positioning the pieces
      - The CSS properties for animating the pieces

      *First concentrate on how to get the elements to look like the final result—then think about animations.*
